## Blob URL

The extraction of a blob URL from videos being visited by the browser works by using the function vid_find() in content.js, it selects all the video tags in the document and pushes their sources into an array of all the video sources.

We believe that the extraction of the blob URLs will be crucial for implementing the downloading functionality in the 2nd iteration.
